### **Smart 3D Elderly Care Community IoT System (S3ECCIS)**  

#### **Background:**  
The concept of this system originated from my involvement in a community-based elderly care service center. I observed that many seniors in the community live alone, suffer from memory decline, or have mobility issues. They struggle to operate household appliances and medical devices properly, leading to significant health risks and even life-threatening situations. Meanwhile, doctors and caregivers in the community are often understaffed, making it difficult to provide adequate care for these individuals.  

To address this, I proposed designing an **IoT-based system incorporating smart hardware and 3D digital twin technology**, leveraging AI and algorithms to enable intelligent control of household appliances and medical devices for seniors living alone or with limited mobility.  

**With user consent and strict privacy/data security measures**, the system collects data such as:  
- Appliance and medical device usage logs  
- Health metrics  
- Movement patterns  

It then constructs a **3D-simulated digital twin of the user’s home environment** on a web platform.  

Doctors and caregivers can use this platform via mobile devices to **remotely monitor** the elderly’s home environment, appliance usage, health data, and movement patterns. With AI-assisted algorithms, the system helps users while **reducing energy consumption**, contributing to environmental protection and lower carbon emissions.

### **Objectives:**  
1. **Pilot Implementation:** Upgrade the homes of two elderly residents with affordable smart devices.  
2. **IoT Service Program:** Develop a real-time data collection and control system for smart and medical devices.  
3. **UWB Positioning:** Use Ultra-Wideband (UWB) wireless technology for real-time indoor tracking.  
4. **3D Digital Twin Web Interface:** Build a web-based dashboard to visualize home data and enable remote device control.  
5. **Automation & Energy-Saving Strategies:**  
   - **Medication reminders** based on smart health band data and schedules.  
   - **Lighting automation** using ambient light sensors and timers.  
   - **HVAC control** via temperature/humidity sensors.  
   - **Emergency power cutoff** in hazardous situations.  
   - **Remote SOS alerts and response mechanisms.**  
6. **AI Optimization:**  
   - **Behavioral pattern learning** to predict daily routines.  
   - **Smart scene automation** (e.g., cutting off kitchen power if appliances are left on unattended to prevent fires).
